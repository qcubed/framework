# Getting started with QCubed

INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

This is by far the easiest way to install.

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

Once installed, you should install the qcubed/app-starter project by executing the following at the command line:

~~~
php composer.phar create-project qcubed/app-starter your_dir_name
~~~

Substitute whatever directory name you would like for "your_dir_name" above. 

Note that if you have taken the composer installation step to rename "composer.phar" to "composer" and you put it in your path, you can instead just enter:

~~~
composer create-project qcubed/app-starter your_dir_name
~~~

Assuming you installed into the document root of your local web server, enter the following to begin the 
configuration process.

~~~
http://localhost/your_dir_name/
~~~

If you would like to eventually place the project somewhere else in your webserver tree, even at the root level, it is
easy to do by modifying the __SUBDIRECTORY__ configuration file setting and moving the contents of the directory to the
new location.

### File System

It begins with the extraction of the QCubed tar ball. If you have downloaded QCubed by cloning the Git Repository then it is not needed. We would recommend that you clone the Git repository (master branch) - it contains the latest stable code. Create a /vendor/qcubed directory within the webserver's DOCROOT (also known as DocumentRoot, webroot, wwwroot, etc., depending on which platform you are using. We will use the word 'DocumentRoot' in this document). Copy the qcubed files to that directory.

At a later point, you may choose to move folders around in your system, splitting them at different location etc.  QCubed offers the flexibility to have the framework files in any location. But that is a story you learn after using the framework (refer to the ```configuration.inc.php.sample``` file in ```includes/configuration``` directory).

But, since we're just getting started, we'll provide you with the instructions on how to finish the installation assuming that you're keeping the entire QCubed installation together as originally released. In the later part of the document, we will call the installation directory (the place where you have copied QCubed framework files) as *instdir*.

**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS**: Please note that all paths should use standard "forward" slashes instead of "backslashes".  So windows paths would look like "c:/xampp/htdocs" instead of "c:\xampp\htdocs".

### Include prepend.inc.php or qcubed.inc.php

Calling ```require()``` on ```prepend.inc.php``` is necessary to include the framework in your PHP file.

Note that by default, this is already setup for you in most files (actually, almost every file that you get with QCubed, or the ones that QCubed generates).

To change this or for any new PHP scripts you want to write, simply make sure any PHP script that wants to utilize the QCubed Framework STARTS with:
	```require('project/includes/configuration/prepend.inc.php');```
on the very first line.

NOTE that the ```project/includes/configuration/prepend.inc.php``` may be different -- it depends on the relative path to the ```project/includes/prepend.inc.php``` file.  So if you have a docroot structure like:
```
	docroot/
	docroot/pages/foo/blah.php
	docroot/project/includes/configuration/prepend.inc.php
```
then in blah.php, the require line will be:
	```require('../../project/includes/configuration/prepend.inc.php');```

Note that if you move your .php script to another directory level, you may need to update the relative path to ```prepend.inc.php```

If you specified the includes/ in your includes_path in your php.ini file (discussed later in this document), then all you need to do is have
	```require('prepend.inc.php');```
at the top of each file (no need to specify a relative path).

#### qcubed.inc.php
Throughout the QCubed installation, you will find a number of ```qcubed.inc.php``` files at a number of places and these files have been used at multiple places as well. While some of these files are pretty important, others are not. The one you should be concerned with is the one located inside the *instdir* (no subdirectories). This file helps in the particular case when you want to move the ```includes``` directory outside the DocumentRoot on webserver. It is a good security practice.

```qcubed.inc.php``` (the file we talked about) calls (includes) the ```prepend.inc.php``` file automatically. So you can also include this file instead of ```prepend.inc.php```. While you are free to choose the way you want, QCubed uses this file to ease the pain of making sure that even the files you create can be moved wherever you want.

If you go to the ```assets``` directory inside *instdir*, then you would find a file named as ```qcubed.inc.php``` too. This file does nothing but include the one in the *instdir*. Another ```qcubed.inc.php``` is located in ```assets/_core``` directory as well, with the same contents. So basically, you can copy and paste these files in any directory you manually create and *include* the file in other php files in the same directory. This will make sure that if you later choose to move the files around, they will not have to undergo path changes in the first ```prepend.inc.php``` include (i.e. you would not have to change a line like ```require_once '../../../includes/configuration/prepend.inc.php``` to ```../../includes/configuration/prepend.inc.php```.

**Moving the includes directory outside DocumentRoot**: We have already said that moving the includes directory out of the DocumentRoot is a good security practice. If you want to do the same, you have 4 steps to follow:

  1. Change the ```__INCLUDES__``` directive in ```project/includes/configuration/configuration.inc.php``` file.
  2. Move the includes directory to another location.
  3. Alther the ```qcubed.inc.php``` file (inside the *instdir* ) to contain the updated location of the includes directory.
  4. Make sure that at all the php files you have written includes the ```qcubed.inc.php``` file instead of ```prepend.inc.php```.

These steps makes sure that you would be able to move around the includes directory elsewhere. Also, it signifies the importance and usage of ```qcubed.inc.php``` located in the *instdir*.

### File Permissions

Because the code generator generates files in multiple locations, you need to be sure that the webserver process has permissions to write to the docroot. The simplest way to do this is just to allow full access to the docroot for everyone.  While this is obviously not recommended for production environments, if you are reading this, we believe it is safe to assume you are working in a development environment. =P

On Unix/Linux, simply run "chmod -R ugo+w" on your docroot directory (or better still, your *instdir* only).

On Windows, you will want to right-click on the docroot folder and select "Properties", go to the "Security" tab, Add a "Everyone" user, and specify that "Everyone" has "Full Control". Also, on the "general" tab, make sure that "Read-Only" is unchecked.  If asked, be sure to apply changes to this folder and all subfolders.

If this doesn't work, an additional task would be to use Start - Control Panel - Administrative Tools - Computer Management - Local Users and Groups - Users.  Look for a user with a name like IUSR_ComputerName (where ComputerName is your computer name).  Right-click on this user then Properties - Member of.  If it just shows Guests, make sure it's selected.  And then finally right-click on your QCubed folder, select Properties, and add the group Guests with Full Control.


### (Optional) Set up the include path

NOTE THAT THIS STEP IS OPTIONAL!  While this adds a VERY slight benefit from a
convenience standpoint, note that doing this will also have a slight performance cost,
and also may cause complications if trying to integrate with other PHP frameworks.

* All PHP scripts will only need to have "require('prepend.inc.php')" without needing
  to specify a relative path.  This makes file management slightly easier; whenever
  you want to move your files in and out of directories/subdirectories, you can do
  so without needing to worry to update the relative paths in your "require"
  statement (see STEP THREE for more information)
* With the include_path in place, you can also easily place other include files
  (like headers, footers, other libraries, etc.) in the includes/ directory, and
  then you can include them, too, without worrying about relative paths

Again, NOTE THAT THIS STEP IS OPTIONAL.

If you wish to do this, then the PREFERRED way of doing this is simply edit your
PHP.INI file, and set the include path to:
	.;c:\path\to\DOCROOT\project\includes\configuration (for windows)
		or
	.:/path/to/DOCROOT/includes/configuration (for unix)
(If you put QCubed into a subdirectory, then you want to make sure to specify it
in include_path by specifying /path/to/DOCROOT/subdir/includes/configuration)

NOTE: the "current directory" marker must be present (e.g. the ".;" or the ".:" at
the beginning of the path)

Now, depending on your server configuration, ISP, webhost, etc., you may
not necessarily have access to the php.ini file on the server.  SOME web servers
(e.g. Apache) will allow you to make folder-level or virtualhost directives
to the php.ini file - however those capabilities are not availed to the user by all hosts.
See the PHP documentation for more information about this and contact your hosting service provider to learn about the possibilities.

ALTERNATIVELY, if you like the idea of being able to simply have ```require('prepend.inc.php')``` (or ```require 'qcubed.inc.php'``` ) with no relative path information at the top of your
pages, but if you are unable for whatever reason to set the include_path, then you could use one of the following "set_include_path" lines at the top of each web-accessed *.php file/script in your web application.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Because the Code Generator can also generate some of your
web-accessed *.php files, you will need to ALSO update the codegen template files
	DOCROOT/project/includes/codegen/templates/db_orm_edit_form_draft.tpl
	DOCROOT/project/includes/codegen/templates/db_orm_list_form_draft.tpl
to have the same "set_include_path" line at the top.

The line to choose depends on whether you're running the PHP engine as a Plug-In/Module
or a CGI (and of course, keep in mind that if you threw QCubed within a subdirectory of
DOCROOT, be sure to specify that in the line you select).

Use this if running PHP as a Apache/IIS/Etc. Plug-in or Module
```set_include_path(sprintf('.%s%s/includes', PATH_SEPARATOR, $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']));```

Use this if running PHP as a CGI executable
```set_include_path(sprintf('.%s%s/includes', PATH_SEPARATOR, substr($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'], 0, strlen($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']) - strlen($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']))));```
